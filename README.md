# Face Mesh Detector and Tracker

This Program shows about 468 Landmarks on any Face in a given Video or in real-time from a Webcam.

## The Algorithm || How it works?

You might ask yourself how precisely does this great tool work...? An Algorithm is the simplest and understandable way
to represent a program.

*Have a look o_o:*

- It receives a video or real-time Capture(ex: from Webcam);
- Using the OpenCV and Mediapipe python libraries, it scans through the given objects(image or webcam captures),
  searching for one thing ~ Faces;
- When detected, it then returns the position(Landmarks) of these Faces in the actual frame;
- Meshes are then drawn around these detected Faces;

## Why use this Program amongst all out there?

Being completely sincere, I will tell you some reasons for you to use this program...

- Few lines of code necessary to execute the Program;
- Our Formatting and Syntax respect the Python code styling rules;
- Comments all over the programs, to ease understanding of the code;
- Try it out to find more interesting features(ex: speed,fps) and let me know...
